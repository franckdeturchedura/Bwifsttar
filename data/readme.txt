This dataset contains sets of vehicle-bridge interaction dynamic simulation for distinct bridges length (10m, 20m and 30m) and roughness road profiles (related to no roughness case, class A and class B profiles). A total of 9 cases were simulated, with 200 random vehicles (testing vehicles) at random speeds, number of axles, spacing and axles weights. Furthermore, a set of calibration runs (training vehicles) with 2 and 4 axle vehicles was also simulated and added.
